# Hotel Website Project Requirements

## Overview
We want to build a **minimalistic, elegant, and high-performance hotel website** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.  

The goal is to provide a **luxury-inspired user interface** that feels clean, modern, and refined. Every interaction should be intuitive, with **simple navigation, spacious layouts, and subtle animations** that enhance elegance.  

This project does **not** require:
- Admin dashboard  
- Database integration  

Focus: **Frontend UI/UX only**.
